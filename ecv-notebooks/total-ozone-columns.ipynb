    "# Exploring an ozone product available through the Climate Data Store (CDS)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we show a practical example on how to investigate ozone products from the [CDS](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-ozone-v1?tab=form). We will explore here the spatial and temporal ozone distribution of the total ozone columns. Total colum means here, the sum over all ozone from ground till top of the atmosphere. These are generally measured from space using earthshine backscattered radiance\n",
    "observations from nadir-viewing instruments. For altitude dependent information we refer to the ozone vertical profiles. \n",
    "In a first step we will show how to retrieve one of the total ozone column dataset from the CDS. This dataset consists out of gridded monthly ozone files, which contain global distributions of ozone vertical columns on a global latitude, longitude grid. \n",
    "In a second step we perform a spatial and temporal analysis of the ozone distribution by visualizing the data. Here we present four typical use cases:\n",
    "* Time series (Hovmöller diagram) of ozone: ozone distribution as a function of latitude over the years.  \n",
    "* The evolution of the global ozone distribution during the course over the year 2021. \n",
    "* The evolution of the ozone hole above the Antarctic continent over the year 2021.\n",
    "* The evolution of the ozone hole above the Antarctic continent over multiple years (1995-2022).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The last step derives conclusions about the plots we made. \n",
    "From the examples in this notebook, one should have an idea on how data from the CDS can be visualized to study total ozone spatial and temporal variability. We encourage the reader to create variations on the examples here provided.  In the end, one should also be able to investigate the other ozone products in similar ways. \n"

    "\n",
    "In this notebook we choose to demonstrate the GTO-ECV product. GTO-ECV is a merged data product, meaning that it was build from an ensemble of bias-corrected single sensor products. The spatial resolution is 1°x1°. An interesting feature of this product is that it provides a consistent and accurate long-term total ozone dataset covering the period from July 1995 until April 2023. Note that this dataset can be extended in time on the CDS, as new data become available. Detailed information on GTO-ECV and on all other ozone products can be found in the documentation section of the CDS. An algorithm description on how those datasets were produced is given in the  Algorithm Theoretical Baseline Document ([ATBD](https://datastore.copernicus-climate.eu/documents/satellite-ozone/C3S2_312a_Lot2_ATBD_O3_latest.pdf)), a guide on the content and on how to use the data is given in the  Product User Guide and Specification document ([PUGS](https://datastore.copernicus-climate.eu/documents/satellite-ozone/C3S2_312a_Lot2_PUGS_O3_latest.pdf)).

    "This plot shows the ozone hole in the southern hemisphere seen from a polar projection, from 1995 to 2022 in October. Up to 2002 the GTO-ECV data record consists out of GOME/ERS-2 data only. This sensor had a relatively sparse spatial sampling compared to\n",
    "the sensors included in GTO-ECV in the later period. Moreover, the size of the GOME ground-pixels was much larger. Global coverage was achieved only after 3 days, which can have a significant impact on monthly mean values, in particular in months characterized by considerable changes in total ozone columns, e.g. boreal or austral spring. The result is the stripy structure in the ozone distribution in the nineties, which vanished with the ingestion of the additional satellite sensors, e.g. OMI, with better sampling."
